# Smapchat -- Snapchat clone for IOS 11
I made this clone to familarize myself with Xcode9 and IOS 11. I used Firebase for the backend and the standard Xcode9 for the front end.  

## How to use this app:
1) Login/signup to begin.
2) Upon a sucessful signin using the preconfigured Firebase Authentication request, the user is presented with the 'recieved snaps' screen where the user can tap to view snaps that were sent (to the user).
3) The user can send a snap by tapping the '+' icon (top right nav item),  

## Screenshots:
These are temporary ... I'm still working on this app :)

## Installation:
Just trying it out:

1) Clone this repo and open with Xcode9.
2) Build and run on the simulator.

Debug, add features, and submit a PR:

3) Reconfigure the Firebase endpoint so that it uses your own Firebase backend instance (as I cannot guarranty my endpoint will still be accessible). Refer to the [firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/) for help, if needed.
